Weather App

Developed a weather application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, integrating OpenWeatherMap's Current Weather API and 5 Day Forecast API.
Implemented features to display current weather details including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and visibility.
Designed a user-friendly interface for intuitive navigation and readability.
Utilized asynchronous JavaScript (AJAX) to fetch data from the APIs and update the UI dynamically.
Implemented error handling to provide a seamless user experience in case of API failures
